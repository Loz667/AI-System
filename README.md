# AI-System

AI system using Behaviour tree, created for Live Creator Challenge 2 of my Mastered bootcamp

-- CHALLENGE --
Implement an AI system, with minimum 3 states, using either State Machine or Behaviour Tree.

-- FINAL OUTCOME --
I chose to go with Behaviour Tree for my submission, as I had recently done some work in State Machines so wanted to explore the alternative. There are 3 states in action: PATROL, CHECK & GATHER.

I'm really pleased with my overall outcome, enjoyed the experince of learning about Behaviour Trees and hpe to use what I have learnt in future projects
